    Given an array of ones and zeroes, convert the equivalent binary value to an integer.

    Eg: [0, 0, 0, 1] is treated as 0001 which is the binary representation of 1.

    Examples:

    Testing: [0, 0, 0, 1] ==> 1
    Testing: [0, 0, 1, 0] ==> 2
    Testing: [0, 1, 0, 1] ==> 5
    Testing: [1, 0, 0, 1] ==> 9
    Testing: [0, 0, 1, 0] ==> 2
    Testing: [0, 1, 1, 0] ==> 6
    Testing: [1, 1, 1, 1] ==> 15
    Testing: [1, 0, 1, 1] ==> 11
    However, the arrays can have varying lengths, not just limited to 4.
